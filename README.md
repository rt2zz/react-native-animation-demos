```
git clone https://github.com/rt2zz/react-native-animation-demos
cd react-native-animation-demos
npm install
```

Notes:
- This uses [navigation-rfc](https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc) is an awesome reimplementation of the navigator which will likely land in react-native core sometime soon
- Checkout `navigation-rfc/CustomComponents/NavigationCard` for some Animated wizardry
- Be sure to run on device to get a realistic idea of the performance of each method
- PR's welcome!
